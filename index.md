### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 is one of my favorite labs because it was the first lab that I coded myself. Compared to Lab 1, which simply replaced code that was already provided, Lab 2 required me to declare and initialize variables, as well as print and store variables. This is a basic, yet vital step in writing functions that work properly, which I will continue to use for any future program I write.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was another favorite lab of mine because it introduced if-else statements. This was important to learn because it helped make my code more efficient. I was able to learn and implement an if else statement that would run according to a specific condition rather than writing multiple different statements. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because it dealt with a program that applied a real-life scenario. It required many different if-else statements that would run according to parking signs. These if-else statements were extremely specific, requiring a certain day of the week and time of the day, making this lab the most difficult one I completed. Still, it was fun to learn and was crucial to finish the labs after it.
